*Post, message, moderate and edit as any user of your forum*

Puppet Master allows the administrator to empower certain users as 'puppet masters' . . . meaning they can use other accounts to post, edit, moderate and message on the forums.

Assign any user to be a puppet master and then assign puppet accounts to them and a simple drop-down will be placed in the Quick Reply, New Thread, New Reply, Full Edit and Messaging pages to allow the puppet master to switch accounts.

No logging in or out is done, the post/thread/message is simply assigned to the chosen account.

## Features

* Assign anyone as a puppet master
* Assign as many puppets per account as desired
* Each puppet master may post, edit, moderate and private message using any of their puppet accounts
* Sessions are updated to retain the facade
